# FARMVESTNG API CHANGELOG

The idea is for an app that will link local farmers to investors so they can get much needed resources to expand their production. The app will work as an intermediary between investors and farmers. The app will sort for farmers, verify them and view their profiles for investors to see. The investors will have a determined rate of return for their investment.
